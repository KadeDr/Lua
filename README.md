# Lua
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.4.4.

## Information
This branch is my test branch. Think of it as a "Beta Version". There may be bugs, and or incomplete features, so don't expect much from it lol.
I think this one is complete, but I haven't tested it on studio yet, so download at your own risk. Thank you for the support!

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Lua.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Lua.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).
