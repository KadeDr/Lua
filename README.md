## Information
This is the official branch. Feel free to download from this and experience the best experience I can provide!
If you have any questions, feel free to send a message in the forums, or send me a DM on my discord, kade6708!
I think this one is complete, but I haven't tested it on studio yet, so download at your own risk. Thank you for the support!

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Lua.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Lua.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
